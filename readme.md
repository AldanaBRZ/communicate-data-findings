# PISA dataset exploration
## by Aldana RodrÃ­guez


## Dataset

> PISA is a survey of students' skills and knowledge as they approach the end of compulsory education. It is not a conventional school test. Rather than examining how well students have learned the school curriculum, it looks at how well prepared they are for life beyond school.
> To work with this dataset I dropped most of it's columns and left only the few that I wanted to use.


## Summary of Findings

> The summary of all my findings is as follows:
>   - The factors that seem to affect a child's grade are:
      - Gender.
      - Wealth.
      - Mathematical anxiety.
      - The schooling of the parents.
    - Wealthier children tend to do better than non-wealthy ones.
    - Children with less mathematical anxiety tend to have better grades.
    - There are some fluctuations between countries but there is no clear trend or relationship between country and children's grades.
    - Women seem to be better at reading, and men seem to be better at math. Both seem to be equally good at science.
    - The more educated the parents are, the better performance the children have.
    - Wealthier children seem to be more successful.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> - Wealthier children tend to be in a higher school grade even though they are all the same age.
> - Wealthier children do better in math, reading and science subjects.
> - Anxious children, on the other hand, do worse the more anxious they are.
> - The more educated the father is, the better the child does in all subjects.
> - The more educated the mother is, the better the child does in all subjects.
> - Children that do better at one subject tend to do better at the other subjects as well.
